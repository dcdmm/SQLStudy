use myemployees;

#1、简单 的使用
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;
SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;
SELECT COUNT(salary) FROM employees;

SELECT SUM(last_name) ,AVG(last_name) FROM employees;
SELECT SUM(hiredate) ,AVG(hiredate) FROM employees;

SELECT MAX(last_name),MIN(last_name) FROM employees;

SELECT MAX(hiredate),MIN(hiredate) FROM employees;

SELECT COUNT(commission_pct) FROM employees;
SELECT COUNT(last_name) FROM employees;

#3、是否忽略null
SELECT SUM(commission_pct) ,AVG(commission_pct),SUM(commission_pct)/35,SUM(commission_pct)/107 FROM employees;

SELECT MAX(commission_pct) ,MIN(commission_pct) FROM employees;

SELECT COUNT(commission_pct) FROM employees;
SELECT commission_pct FROM employees;


#4、和distinct搭配

SELECT SUM(DISTINCT salary),SUM(salary) FROM employees;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT salary),COUNT(salary) FROM employees;

#5、count函数的详细介绍

SELECT COUNT(salary) FROM employees;


SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees; # 统计个数

SELECT COUNT(1) FROM employees;

/*
效率：
MYISAM存储引擎下  ，COUNT(*)的效率高
INNODB存储引擎下，COUNT(*)和COUNT(1)的效率差不多，比COUNT(字段)要高一些
*/

#6、和分组函数一同查询的字段有限制

SELECT AVG(salary),employee_id  FROM employees; # 一个是标量一个是列表,没有意义
